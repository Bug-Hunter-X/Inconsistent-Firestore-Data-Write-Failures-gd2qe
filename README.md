This repository demonstrates a problem with inconsistent Firestore data write failures in a JavaScript application. The issue is that write operations sometimes succeed without actually writing data, and this occurs without any apparent error message. The `firestoreBug.js` file contains the problematic code, while `firestoreBugSolution.js` offers a solution that addresses the underlying issue of improper data handling and asynchronous operations.
