The issue was traced to improper handling of asynchronous operations and the use of an outdated method of updating Firestore data. The original code used a simple `set()` method without proper error handling or consideration for the asynchronous nature of Firestore operations. To resolve this, the solution uses `set()` with error handling and incorporates a more robust approach, ensuring the data is correctly written. The solution includes checking the promise returned by `set()` to ensure successful execution and providing feedback to the user if an error occurs. Additionally, the code now employs more efficient methods for managing data updates, eliminating potential race conditions.
